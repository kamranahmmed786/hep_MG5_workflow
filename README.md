# MadGraph5 Configuration And Sample Generation

This repository provides detailed step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the following software components required for High Energy Physics simulations using **MadGraph5_aMC@NLO** on a Condor-based cluster and a standalone PC.

Each guide is modular and focused on a specific part of the installation process.
